Hand Sign Language Detection using MediaPipe and Machine Learning

The "Hand Sign Language Detection" project focuses on interpreting and recognizing hand signs in sign language, utilizing the MediaPipe library and machine learning techniques. Sign language plays a vital role in communication for individuals with hearing impairments, and this project aims to enhance communication by converting hand gestures into meaningful text and speech.

The implementation is carried out in Python programming, employing multithreading to synchronize text and speech recognition. This ensures efficient and high-speed recognition of hand signs. The system will be capable of processing real-time video streams or images from a camera.
but has limitations of limited dataset leading to unable to recognize many signs due to lack of dataset.

Gestures Involved in this trained dataset are:

okay
peace
Yes
No
call me
stop
I Like You  
Hi
fist
smile
